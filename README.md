## Story and Idea

Welcome to Avoid, an all in one COVID-19 platform Designed to satisfy the critical information needs the pandemic has uncovered. 
We've designed Avoid to be an easy, compact, and efficient platform, using one of the most reliable API's out there; Google Maps API, 
among others. Users get real time COVID-19 statistics, data, and actionable functionality like nearby testing locations that are being 
updated live by a variety of advanced APIs such as the COVID Project API utilized by The Atlantic.

Avoid differs from similar apps as it has an easy to maneuver user interface, real time Coronavirus updates, and testing centers nearby 
with optimal location generation using Geocoding features. Avoid also provides the latests in corona virus news and updates
with functionality such as relevant article recommendations hand picked for the user, and streams of general coronavirus information.

The Avoid team is always looking for new opportunities, and thus we're making the app compatible with future pandemics/issues,
such as natural disasters, virus outbreaks, and many other issues that will be sure to impact many people in desperate times.
The team greatly appreciate your time. We hope that Avoid can in some way shape or form make your life easier and serve you with great value.

Best,

The Avoid Team
